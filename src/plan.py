# We'll say that a positive int divides itself
# if every digit in the number divides into the
# number evenly.

#Example 1:
# So for example 128 divides itself
# since 1, 2, and 8 all divide into 128 evenly. 

#Example 2:
# And we'll say that 0 does not divide into anything
# evenly, so no number with a 0 digit divides itself. 

# Write a function to determine if a number divides itself.
